Dynamic Networks is intended as a tool to be used alongside Gephi (https://gephi.github.io/)
The tool works with incidence matrices that are saved as a .csv file.
The tool is only useful if the columns of the matrix represent events that are put in temporal order.
An example is offered below.

        Event1    Event2    Event3    Event4
ActorA    1         0         1         0
ActorB    0         1         0         1
ActorC    1         1         0         0

The tool can be used to convert the incidence matrix into various types of edge lists that can
be imported into Gephi.
